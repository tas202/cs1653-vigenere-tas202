plaintext:
Congratulations! By decrypting this message, you have completed step one of this
assignment. To complete the next step of the assignment, you must submit the
code of the tools you used to decrypt this message in a Github repository.
You probably used a Kasiski examination, and then a brute-force on all keys of
the discovered length(s). Submit the code you used for both of these steps to a
private Github repository named cs1653-vigenere-abc123, where abc123 is your
Pitt username. Share this repository with the TA (meunal). If you solved step
one using entirely pen and paper, scan your handwritten document and submit it.
In either case, submit a readme file describing your approach. If you have little
documentation about your solution, you may choose to implement a basic Kasiski
examination to ensure that you get full points on this step of the assignment.

How I solved this homework:
  First when I was examining the ciphertext I noticed some word lengths and words that seemed familiar. I first noticed ks1653-... which I
knew was cs1653-something-username just by looking at it. Also by looking at the number of z's and x's i made the conclusion that this was
some sort of substitution cipher, since a transposition cipher would mean the z and x's would be part of the plaintext that seemed 
unlikely. I next saw the first word which looked very similar to congratulations! and i noticed they were the same length. I then did 
the work you can see above to get the key. I discovered it used the vigenere cipher with the key = alkindi .  I then searched the web 
for a vignere cipher text decrypter and used https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher .
